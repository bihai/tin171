%%COMMENT
Dialog systems are AI systems in which an agent is capable of interaction with
an user through natural language. We give some hints of how to build such a
system in the context of a student help-desk. More precisely, this system
should allow an user (supposedly a student) to ask specific questions through
a terminal, and get useful answers back from the system. To be able to build
such a system we will use tools like the Grammatical Framework (GF) that is
described in \cite{ranta-2011}.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The problem or area you are interested in}
% Extract an accurate description of the problem from the project description or
% from your pre-proposal, or lift that material to a general problem specificat-
% ion.
Natural language processing is a very wide topic. In this survey we only
consider written natural language processing, but there exists plenty of
softwares that can recognise spoken language, or the mood of the user through
its intonation or gestures. In our case, the user will interact with the machine
by typing questions into a terminal. The program will then parse the question
and analyse its content in order to give an answer that is as relevant as
possible.

\subsection{Significance}
% Why is the problem interesting or significant? What will a solution achieve?
This problem seems interesting to us because it would give an alternative to
the usual FAQ interface that most websites offer. The student help-desk example
seems appropriate since there are plenty of data that we can use as a knowledge
base for our system.

\subsection{Aspects of the problem covered by this survey}
% Describe these briefly. You could write a small paragraph for each of them,
% highlighting keywords, and citing the relevant papers. The keywords could be
% used as sub-section headings in the survey proper, in section 3.
In this survey we will emphasize on \textbf{parsing} natural language, and
\textbf{generating} natural language. In other words we will talk about the
\textbf{interface between the machine and the human} user, which is a very
important part of natural language processing.

\subsection{Important aspects of the problem not covered here}
% Aspects of the problem one must know to understand it completely, but not
% included in the discussion. Use this subsection to ensure a good coverage of
% the relevant literature without going through much detail.
We will not discuss much the middle part of our question answering system, which
is the choice of the information to give to the user given an abstract syntax of
the language.
% TODO
% add a reference for machine learning
% add a reference for generating the knowledge-base form FAQ data

\section{Framework}
% Here you describe which solution approach(es) you would have chosen if this
% would have been your course project. Use your own words, write down
% definitions, etc., )
In order to parse and generate  natural language, we would use the Grammatical
Framework (GF) described in \cite{ranta-2011}. This seems like a good idea since
once we have designed a grammar, it is possible to make it support different
languages quite easyly.

For the information choosing part, there are several possibilities, but since
we only process questions, we can get a lot of informations from the syntax. For
example, if the question starts with the word "where", we know that the user is
looking for some place (a room, or a building). It reduced a lot the set of
possible answers. With a well-structured knowledge-base, and some machine
learning based on an user feedback system, it should be possible to get a robust
system.

\subsection{Define formally an instance of the problem}
% Either mathematically, or using pseudo-code. Also, give an example.
% TODO give an example of usage

\subsection{Benchmarks}
% How would you measure the performance of a program that solves the problem?
% Find instances/benchmarks, or make your own).
% TODO
% I don't really know what should be here...

\section{Survey}
\subsection{Results from the literature}
% Describe briefly the scientific papers you found relevant to the problem.
% Ideally, a commented summary of each paper, like an extended annotation.
% Cite references. You could organize this section by keyword, one sub-section
% for each keyword you specified in 1.3.
% TODO
% I still have to find some references.

\subsection{Tools and programs available for the problem, or for closely related ones}
% Describe these briefly. Say how they can be used, and how a solution to your
% problem can build on them, or differ from them.
% TODO
% Obviously some stuff about GF, and it would be nice to talk about other
% sytems too.

% \section{References}
\bibliographystyle{aiaa}
\bibliography{refs}

% \section{Appendix}
% The previous sections (excluding title page and references) are limited to 6
% pages. Here, you can put in anything that didn't fit in there, but that you
% still think is essential.
% TODO
% We probably won't need an apendix.
