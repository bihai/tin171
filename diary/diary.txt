The group is formed and we decide to have a meeting on Monday.
2012-03-19
Our first meeting is a success. We decide on three projects: NLP1, L1
and S1. There are two ideas for what game to use with S1, but after
some deliberation (and a coin flip) we choose Chinese Checkers.
We have a meeting with a supervisor tomorrow.
2012-03-20
We meet with a supervisor and ask him about our project ideas. There
do not appear to be any problems with them. We receive some useful
information and decide on how to divide the work for the rest of the
week. Emil will research movie recommendation systems, Rodolphe takes
care the dialogue system (looking into Grammatical Framework and other
options). Göran and Salvo search for literature on Chinese Checkers.
2012-03-21
Göran writes a draft of the pre-proposal for the Chinese Checkers
project.
