The group is formed and we decide to have a meeting on Monday.
2012-03-19
Our first meeting is a success. We decide on three projects: NLP1, L1
and S1. There are two ideas for what game to use with S1, but after
some deliberation (and a coin flip) we choose Chinese Checkers.
We have a meeting with a supervisor tomorrow.
2012-03-20
We meet with a supervisor and ask him about our project ideas. There
do not appear to be any problems with them. We receive some useful
information and decide on how to divide the work for the rest of the
week. Emil will research movie recommendation systems, Rodolphe takes
care the dialogue system (looking into Grammatical Framework and other
options). Göran and Salvo search for literature on Chinese Checkers.
2012-03-21
Göran writes a draft of the pre-proposal for the Chinese Checkers
project.

Created the add_entry script

We all meet to work on the pre-proposal. Salvo and Rodolphe have been
trying to get cheech to compile and also tried to find alternatives to
cheech. Salvo tells us about an old Master's thesis on the subject of
Chinese Checkers and we learn a few things from that. The pre-proposal
is almost finished.

Salvo and Rodolphe tried to compile some chinese checkers clients such as
cheech. Which unfortunately uses library calls that do not exist anymore and
would require some time to be fixed (and additional time to learn the GTK
front end for C++).

Our last meeting before the pre-proposal deadline. Emil announces that
he's started working on a Chinese Checkers server written in Erlang.
The state of freely available Chinese Checkers programs is pretty
deplorable, so having our own game server may turn out to be a good
idea. Emil has filled in the few missing parts of the pre-proposal.
Only some small problems remain, which we fix before submitting.
2012-03-25
Rodolphe began to write the survey about the dialog system (NLP) and
is also looking for additional references.
2012-03-27
We have agreed on a way to represent the board using an unidimensional array.

Salvo started a GUI client, that will use PyQT libraries. Managed to find a
nice vectorial board image on wikipedia and a way to modify it according to the
array representation that we have decided to use for the board.
