 abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue on Personalized and Mobile Digital TV Applications; Guest Editor: Konstantinos Chorianopoulos Collaborative and content-based filtering are the major methods in recommender systems that predict new items that users would find interesting. Each method has advantages and shortcomings of its own and is best applied in specific situations. Hybrid approaches use elements of both methods to improve performance and overcome shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach based on content-based and collaborative filtering, implemented in MoRe, a movie recommendation system. We also provide empirical comparison of the hybrid approach to the base methods of collaborative and content-based filtering and draw useful conclusions upon their performance.

 abstract={ This paper presents an overview of the field of recommender systems and describes the current generation of recommendation methods that are usually classified into the following three main categories: content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommendation approaches. This paper also describes various limitations of current recommendation methods and discusses possible extensions that can improve recommendation capabilities and make recommender systems applicable to an even broader range of applications. These extensions include, among others, an improvement of understanding of users and items, incorporation of the contextual information into the recommendation process, support for multicriteria ratings, and a provision of more flexible and less intrusive types of recommendations.},
