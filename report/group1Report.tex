%%COMMENT (re-use from project proposal and modify if needed)
Chinese Checkers is a board game for up to six players. The fact that
it is a multi-player game makes it quite different from more widely
explored two-player games like Chess. In writing a computer player for
Chinese Checkers we have explored search algorithms and heuristics.
Our aim is to highlight the ways in which multi-player games differ
from two-player games, and the consequences this has for the
effectiveness of a computer player.

%% Fill in with ideas for what to write about:

%% * The multiplayer aspect
%% ** The search-tree explodes with many players
%%    -- Especially in the middle of the game when alot of more paths open up
%% ** So what else changes with three or more players?
%%    -- Connected to the last one, there may be more paths around the
%%       middle than through it with more players
%% ** What about a bot that recognizes others of its ilk and conspires?
%% * 2/3-phase bot? Using IDDFS-bot in the beginning, reverting to minimax
%%   and maybe ending with iddfs also?
%% * How does the bot play against a human?

\section{Appendix}
% (Here you include the diary and all other information and
% documentation that did not fit into the report in the above sections
% but that you consider too important to leave out.)

The development of our programs and our report took place on GitHub.
Our project website is \url{https://github.com/rlepigre/tin171}. The
diary directory contains a detailed account of who did what and when.
To see where some code or text came from it is possible to inspect the
commit history as well. The website also houses the actual numbers for
the board evaluation functions.

%% A quick tutorial on how the server works
%% Maybe a quick overlook of the gui-client?
