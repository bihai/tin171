\subsection{Significance}

An interesting aspect of Chinese Checkers is that it is a multi-player
game. This means that players can form temporary coalitions against
other players. While traditional two-player strategies can be used to
play the game, they are not going to be able to play it perfectly and
in this sense Chinese Checkers is still an open problem. Working on an
open problem is always interesting.

The multi-player attribute provides a good setting for objectively
evaluating the performance of different algorithms and heuristics. The
existing literature is somewhat sparse on how existing computer
programs fare against humans in multi-player Chinese Checkers. We hope
to rectify that with this report.

\subsection{The central idea}

The architecture of our solution consists of three parts: a game
server written in Erlang, a graphical game client written in Python
and several autonomous game clients. A network protocol has been
specified that supports multiple running games. The server coordinates
the game and tells each player what is happening to the board and
prompts players to make their move. The server verifies that the moves
are legal and checks if there is a winner. The graphical client can
connect either as a player or a spectator. It shows a graphical
representation of the board and lets the user make moves.

When it is a computer player's turn it needs to generate the possible
moves and select the best one. In order to select the best one our bot
uses search algorithms combined with board evaluation functions. A
board evaluation function returns a number that is larger when the
board is better for the player. The search algorithm will be looking
for the move that maximizes that number.

We have a number of different bots that are based on different
combinations of search algorithms and board evaluation functions. Our
first computer player used a simple search algorithm that did
basically no lookahead: it merely considered the result from the board
evaluation function for every possible move. The board evaluation
function was based on the Euclidean distance between each peg and the
goal. When we have implemented new search algorithms and board
evaluation functions we have kept the old ones around for comparison.

\subsection{Search algorithms}

Our first real search algorithm was an implementation of
\emph{iterative deepening depth-first-search} (IDDFS) \cite{aimodern}.
It tries to consider what would happen after it has made a particular
move: does that move give the bot a big benefit at its next turn, or
the turn after that? This algorithm is shown in figure \ref{iddfs}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{IDDFS}{board, player-id, time-limit}
\State best.move = \emph{nil}
\State best.score = $-\infty$
\State best.depth = $\infty$
\For{depth $= 0 \to \infty$}
 \ForAll{move $\in$ \textsc{All-Possible-Moves}(board, player-id)}
  \State nboard = \textsc{Update-Board}(board, move)
  \State \textsc{Recursive-DLS}(move, nboard, depth, 0, best)
 \EndFor
 \If{timeout}
  \State \Return best.move
 \EndIf
\EndFor
\EndFunction
\\
\Function{Recursive-DLS}{move1, board, limit, depth, best}
\State score = \textsc{Board-Evaluation}(board, player-id)
\If{score $>$ best.score $\vee$ (score $=$ best.score $\wedge$ depth $<$
best.depth)}
\State best.move = move1
\State best.score = score
\State best.depth = depth
\EndIf
\If{limit $\le$ 0 $\vee$ timeout}
\State \Return
\EndIf
\ForAll{move $\in$ \textsc{All-Possible-Moves}(board, player-id)}
 \State nboard = \textsc{Update-Board}(board, move)
 \State \textsc{Recursive-DLS}(move1, nboard, limit$-1$, depth$+1$, best)
\EndFor
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Iteratively-deepening depth-limited search with a time limit.}
\label{iddfs}
\end{figure}

The IDDFS algorithm is rather na\"ive, because it only considers its
own moves and never the opponent's. Because of this the bot's agenda
can be destroyed by the opponent by blocking the path it was about to
take.

To counter this we can use the minimax algorithm, that tries to
\emph{minimize} the board-evaluation function for itself while trying
to \emph{maximize} the board-evaluation function of its opponent. We
have implemented minimax in the way shown in figure \ref{minimax}.

%% MINIMAX
\begin{figure}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{Minimax}{board, player-id, depth}
  \State best.score = $-\infty$
  \ForAll{move $\in$ \textsc{All-Possible-Moves}(board, player-id)}
    \State val = -\textsc{Minimax-Value}(\textsc{Update-Board}(board, move), \\
    \hspace{160pt} player-id, depth-1)
    \If{val $>$ score}
      \State best.score = val
      \State best.move = move
    \EndIf
  \EndFor
  \State \Return best.move
\EndFunction
\\
\Function{Minimax-Value}{board, player-id, depth}
\If{\textsc{Won}(board, player-id)}
  \State \Return winning score
\ElsIf{depth $=$ 0}
  \State \Return \textsc{Board-Evaluation}(board, player-id)
\Else
  \State opp-id = \textsc{Opponent}(player-id)
  \State best = $-\infty$
  \ForAll{move $\in$ \textsc{Possible-Moves}(board, opp-id)}
    \State val = -\textsc{Minimax-Value}(\textsc{Update-Board}(board, move), \\
    \hspace{180pt} opp-id, depth-1)
    \If{val $>$ best}
      \State best = val
    \EndIf
  \EndFor
  \State \Return best
\EndIf
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Minimax algorithm.}
\label{minimax}
\end{figure}

A problem with minimax is that the search tree is incredibly large.
Not only do you have to consider all your own possible moves, but you
also have to consider those of the opponents. In our minimax algorithm
we only consider one of the opponents, but this still makes the search
tree much larger than for IDDFS. A standard technique for reducing the
search tree is alpha-beta pruning. We have implemented this algorithm
as well.

The minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning is well-equipped for
two-player games. Unfortunately the technique does not work as well
for games with more than two players \cite{Korf199199}.

\subsection{Heuristics}

Functions to evaluate boards must be used to estimate which moves are
better than others, and also to perform pruning. One idea we have used
is to consider the board as a two-dimensional array and compute the
Euclidean distance of all the pegs from their target position.

Another board evaluation function of ours uses a hand-tuned distance
function that counts the the number of moves (excluding jumps)
necessary to reach the corner position in the target. The hand-tuned
distance function uses an array of weights: one for each position on
the board at which a peg can stop. The weights are then summed up over
all the player's pegs. Figure \ref{handtuned} shows a graphical
representation of that function. This function takes several things
into consideration.

In test games between the bots, it was noted that while moving to
non-central positions can constitute a disadvantage in two players games, it can
represent a good strategy on more populated boards where the moves available in
the central area are very limited. As a consequence the heuristics that prove to
be effective on one scenario can lead the bot to defeat in other scenarios.
Having said that, a good heuristic for two players games seems to assign more
value to boards that keep the pegs in the central area of the board, as
described in \cite{ulfhake}.

The approach of keeping all the pegs in a cluster to allow jumps and to give low
values to boards where the pegs of a certain player are scattered all around is
a good solution for two players games, but in other cases the board is crowded
so there are several opportunities to perform long jumps even for pegs isolated
from the other ones of the same color.

The three pegs located in the deepest positions of the corner risk being trapped
by the opponent if they are left behind, so the hand-tuned distance function has
been modified to assign to these positions a great penalty.

Since we are in the field of Artificial Intelligence our thoughts
were drawn to the idea of having the computer make the distance
function itself. We have used our hand-tuned distance function to run
a genetic algorithm that finds better distance functions.
