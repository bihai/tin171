\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
\subsection{Bot VS human player}
The goal of our project was to propose machine players that could beat a
novice human player. Among our bots, only a few can pretend to beat an human
player, and none is really equiped to play against en expert player. The bots
that hove proven to be the most effective against an human player are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the \textbf{Alpha-Beta bot}, even if it sometimes leave a peg behind.
        This bot uses the board evaluation function generated with the genetic
        algorithm.
  \item the \textbf{Evolved Alpha-Beta bot}, which uses the board evaluation
        function generated with the genetic algorithm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Our goal have been fulfilled, and many ideas of futur developpement have
arised. The multi-player side of Chinese Checkers make it very interesting,
but in the meantime very complicated.

Algorithms for solving multi-player games have been discussed recently in
\cite{Hashavit} and \cite{bestreplysearch}, but there have not been much
discussion about them in the scientific world. However investigating them
would be a very natural continuation for this project.

One of our most interesting discovery was about the genetic algorithm, and
it would be nice to see how far it could get by making the generations play
against several different bots. The game with 5 and 6 players remains to be
explored completely.
