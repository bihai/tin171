\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
%(Sum up your project, suggest future extensions and improvements.)

Our computer program can win a game against a human.
Our goal has been fulfilled and many ideas for future development have
been brought to light.
The multi-player side of Chinese Checkers remains largely unexplored
for us but it is still very interesting while in the meantime being rather
complicated.

Algorithms for solving multi-player games have been discussed recently in
\cite{Hashavit} and \cite{bestreplysearch}, but there have not been much
discussion about them in the scientific world. However investigating them
would be a very natural continuation for this project.

One of our most interesting discovery was about the genetic algorithm, and
it would be interesting to see how far it could get by making the generations play
against several different bots. The game with 5 and 6 players remains to be
explored completely.
