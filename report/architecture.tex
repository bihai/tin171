Our project is divided into a collection of programs that each solve
different parts of the problem. The programs communicate using a
network protocol that we have designed. Our choice to use a network
protocol has let us write the programs in different programming
languages. We have one server implementation, a graphical client and a
bot client.

%% TODO: note the cli client and the hs client?

Players connect to a \emph{game server} which maintains the current
game state, notifies each player of their turn and checks that the
rules of the game are not violated. A player can host a game or join a
game someone else is hosting. It is also possible to join as a
spectator and see what is going on in a game. If the game is over the
server also announces who the winner was. The server is written in
Erlang and can host multiple games simultaneously.

The \emph{graphical client} is written in Python and is designed for a
human player. The main part of the interface is the current board
state, shown as the star that one would normally see a on real life
version of the game. When it is the players' turn they can make their
move by clicking on the pegs shown on the screen.

The \emph{bot} is the program that contains the AI components of our
project. It is also written in Python and is divided in three major
components: the protocol module, the board module and the bot module.
The \emph{protocol module} serializes and deserializes the network protocol.
The \emph{board module} contains code to generate all moves a player has
available and it also contains our board evaluation functions. The
\emph{bot module} contains the search algorithms. It is the job of the search
algorithms to use the possible moves and the board evaluation
functions to determine which move will give the best outcome for the
bot. When we have implemented a new search algorithm or board
evaluation function the previous ones are still available. Each
combination of search algorithm and evaluation function is given a
\emph{bot personality} identifier.

An important part of our project is not only to implement search
algorithms and heuristics, but to also measure their performance. To
aid in this we have the \emph{arena} program. This program can start
up a game between different bot personalities so that we can determine
which bot is the strongest in different situations.
