To be able to test different approaches, the bot supports multiple
functions. In general, Python is a slow interpreted language, but
there are projects that aim at providing just in time compilation. The
PyPy interpreter has proven to be somewhat faster than the standard
CPython. When PyPy is forced to compile loops, after a few iterations,
the IDDFS algorithm is able to compute one level deeper. Because the
algorithm is time-limited this gives the bot running on PyPy an
advantage over the bots running on CPython.

We have a time-limited implementation of iterative-deepening depth
first search based on an algorithm from \cite{aimodern}. When the
algorithm compares two moves that achieve an equally good outcome it
will explicitly favor the move that achieves the outcome sooner (at a
lower search depth). If this check is omitted the algorithm can end up
looping at the end of a game. This is because it would make a move
that would be the winning move two moves into the future, but on the
next turn it might again choose a move that wins two moves into the
future, \emph{ad infinitum}.
